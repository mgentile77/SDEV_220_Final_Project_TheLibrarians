Project Concept

Our project is designed for operation in a non-profit small library setting.  We have found a database of books and created a test database of members.  These databases are set onto an Excel workbook.  We will program our system to interact with different activity levels within the library system to utilize these databases.  Some of what we are planning includes but is not limited to:

This is what our backend is capable of providing:

Querying books by Author and or Title
Querying members by member ID, or member name and address
Reporting of catalog status
Reporting of member late status
Sending of book receipts when borrowed 
Adding/deleting members and books from a database
Automating fines and availability statuses

We were able to provide an easy-to-use interface that provides reports.
Currently, usage is as straight forward as clicking a button for your desired option.
